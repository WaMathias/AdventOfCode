# Advent of Code

This project should serve as a learning by doing project.
I want to learn more about:

- rust
- python

Because I am trying to learn VIM/NVIM, I will, at least I hope to,
learn more about those Text Editors!

Maybe I will implement some more languages, like Java, or Assembly, but not in
near future!
